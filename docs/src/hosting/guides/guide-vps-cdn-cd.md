# Guide: Continuous Deployment Using VPS and CDN (Preferred Method) [DRAFT]

This guide details how to host Holenav with automatic updates using a virtual private server (VPS), an external MongoDB service and a content delivery network (CDN).

:::tip
This is the "official" deployment and upgrade method in the sense that it is what I am using for running the staging environment. Keeping this deployment path stable is a priority in development, and in that sense implementing a similar pipeline is probably the easiest way to host Holenav.
:::

:::warning
Using continuous deployment, i.e., updating Holenav automatically, leaves you vulnerable to the risk of a malicious release being published. Essentially you will be leaving your in-game operational security up to the Holenav author(s). Should you choose to vet releases and update by hand, you can simply leave out the [last part](#update-backend-automatically) of this guide.

## Required Services

Required services to host Holenav as per this guide:

- VPS (Virtual Private Server) instance with Docker runner for hosting the backend.
- MongoDB SaaS access for providing a database to the backend.
- CDN (Content Delivery Network) access to deploy the frontend. ([Vercel](https://vercel.com/), if you want to use the exact same GitHub action as in this guide.)
- GitHub account.
- Domain.

Most of these services can be used for free for moderate amounts of traffic â€“ a proper VPS service might be hard to find for free.

:::tip
A custom domain is not strictly required, however this guide assumes you have one. At a bare minimum, you must have a static domain for both the backend and the frontend. (If using an IP address, you will face a terrible certificate battle to enable SSL, and without SSL, virtually no browser will connect to the backend.)
:::

:::danger
This guide uses GitHub and Vercel tokens to deploy the frontend. _**When managing your Holenav instance in a team, you should create dedicated user accounts for GitHub and Vercel.**_ This is necessary because anyone who has access to your VPS will be able to read your GitHub token which enables full control of your repos. By extension, they would be able to control your Vercel account as well.

### Service Providers

Service providers used when writing this guide:

- VPS: [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) CX11
- Database: [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) M0 Sandbox
- CDN: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) Hobby
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)

Note that these are provided for reference and to make cloning my setup easier. I do not receive any compensation for mentioning the companies.

## Setup Domain Records

This guide uses `holenav.com` as an example domain. Replace it with your own. Create the host records in the following table using your DNS provider.

| Record Type | Host  | Value                     | TTL       |
| ----------- | ----- | ------------------------- | --------- |
| A           | `api` | _Your backend IP address_ | Automatic |
| CNAME       | `@`   | `cname.vercel-dns.com`    | Automatic |

With this DNS setup, backend URL would be `api.holenav.com` and frontend URL just `holenav.com`. If you are not using Vercel, find out from your CDN provider what kind of a DNS record you need to make.

## Configure Frontend Deployment

The frontend is implemented as a React app that is served to users via CDN. In this setup, frontend deployment is triggered by the backend after it has been successfully updated. The backend makes a request to a GitHub webhook dispatching a workflow that deploys the frontend.

### Create Vercel Project

Create a new project in Vercel dashboard. In _Project Settings_, add an environment variable named `REACT_APP_CMS_URL` and set its value to your backend URL (e.g. `https://api.holenav.com`).

Next, go to _Personal Account Settings_ and create a new token. It will be used to deploying the frontend from GitHub.

###  Create GitHub Workflow to Deploy Frontend

TBA.

## Serve Backend on VPS

The backend is hosted on a standard Ubuntu VPS instance using Docker and the `holenav-server` image provided through GitHub Container Registry (GHCR). Additionally, Caddy is set up as a proxy server to provide automatic SSL certificate management.

MongoDB is required when setting up the backend, so make sure to set that up before continuing. If you are using MongoDB Atlas, the free service tier is of type _Shared Cluster_ and _M0 Sandbox_.

### Create `docker-compose.yml`

TBA.

```yaml
version: "3.7"

services:
  server:
    image: ghcr.io/joonashak/holenav-server:latest
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    container_name: holenav-server
    env_file:
      - server.production.env
    restart: unless-stopped
    logging:
      driver: "local"

  proxy:
    image: caddy:2
    container_name: holenav-caddy
    ports:
      - "443:443"
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - /root/staging/caddy/data:/data
      - /root/staging/caddy/config:/config
      - /root/staging/caddy/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
      - /usr/local/share/ca-certificates:/data/caddy/pki/authorities/local
    restart: unless-stopped
    logging:
      driver: "local"
```

## Update Backend Automatically

TBA.

### Choose Version Tag to Limit Update Scope
