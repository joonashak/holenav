[Continuous Deployment Using VPS and CDN](guide-vps-cdn-cd.md) is the preferred way to host Holenav. It is currently the only hosting and upgrading method considered in development, and in that sense the safest option.

If you have perfected another method, please write it up in the docs and make a PR so others can take advantage of it too!
