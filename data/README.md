# Static Data Assets

Rudimentary tool to generate the static data required by Holenav from EVE Static Data Export (SDE).

## Commands

Generate data files:

```bash
npm run generate
```

## Caveats

- `typeIDs.yaml` is incorrectly formatted. So far, I have simply manually copied stuff from it to `assets/`.
